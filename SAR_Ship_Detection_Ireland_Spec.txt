# SAR Ship Detection - Irish Waters Pipeline
- Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-Level Tasks and generate the code that satisfies the High and Mid-Level Objectives.

## High Level Overview
Develop and deploy a Sentinel-1 SAR ship detection pipeline to identify and catalog surface vessels in Irish coastal waters and exclusive economic zone. The project leverages proven SAR amplitude-based detection techniques including CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) algorithms and polarimetric analysis to detect ships across major shipping lanes, fishing areas, and offshore installations around Ireland.

## End State Output/ Visualisation
This project will assemble and preprocess Sentinel-1 SAR data to detect and catalog ships in Irish waters using amplitude-based detection algorithms. The workflow will generate ship detection masks, confidence scores, and produce a comprehensive Geoparquet catalog with spatial and temporal metadata for maritime surveillance and traffic analysis applications.

## Implementation Details
    # Stream of consciousness walkthrough of agent tasks and technical highlights
    
    Start with a solid SAR ship detection foundation - we need 1_generate_s1_catalog.py for ASF API scene discovery focused on Irish waters, 2_scene_selector.py for optimal scene selection considering weather and sea state, and sentinel1_ship_detection.py for SNAP-based SAR processing and detection.
    
    Geographic focus is Irish coastal waters and EEZ - bounding box approximately (-11.0, 51.0, -5.0, 56.0) covering major shipping lanes including Dublin-Liverpool, Cork-France routes, and fishing areas off the west coast. Smaller area than global coverage so processing should be manageable.
    
    SAR ship detection relies on amplitude contrast - ships appear as bright targets against darker sea background. Implement CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) detection with adaptive thresholding. Key is balancing detection sensitivity with false alarm rate - maritime environment has various clutter sources (waves, weather, sea ice, oil spills).
    
    Land-sea masking is critical - need high-quality Irish coastline data (probably from OSI or Marine Institute) to exclude land-based false alarms. Complex Irish coastline with many islands and inlets requires careful mask preparation and alignment with SAR geometry.
    
    SNAP processing chain needs SAR-specific preprocessing: radiometric calibration, speckle filtering (Lee or Refined Lee), terrain correction for coastal areas. This processing focuses on single-scene amplitude optimization without requiring coregistration.
    
    CFAR implementation is core algorithm - sliding window approach with guard cells to estimate local sea clutter statistics. Adaptive window sizing based on sea state and resolution. Need to handle edge cases near coastlines and in shipping lanes with multiple targets.
    
    False alarm mitigation through morphological filtering - ships have characteristic size/shape signatures. Filter out point targets (likely speckle), very large targets (likely weather), and targets with wrong aspect ratios. Ship wake detection can provide additional validation.
    
    AIS integration for ground truth - Irish Coast Guard and Marine Institute provide AIS feeds. Spatial-temporal matching within reasonable tolerances (±500m, ±30min) accounting for AIS transmission delays and GPS accuracy. Not all vessels transmit AIS (fishing boats, military, etc.).
    
    Output to Geoparquet with maritime-specific partitioning - by Irish maritime zones (inshore, offshore, EEZ), by vessel size categories, temporal partitioning by month/season. Include rich metadata: detection confidence, RCS estimates, sea state conditions, processing parameters.
    
    Libraries: asf_search for data discovery, esa_snappy for SNAP processing, geopandas for spatial operations, pyarrow for Parquet I/O, rasterio for raster processing, scikit-image for morphological operations, numpy/scipy for CFAR algorithms.
    
    Key technical challenges: SNAP memory management, CFAR parameter optimization for Irish conditions, AIS data quality and availability, handling complex coastline geometry, weather-related false alarms, small vessel detection limits.
